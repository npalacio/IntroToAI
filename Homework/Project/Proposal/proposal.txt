Problem Statement
-Predicting flight delays after takeoff
-Why it is important test
    -The logistics of airlines and flights can be incredibly complex
    -Airlines need to know if a flight is going to be arriving late because this could have a chain reaction on other flights
    -Passengers or people waiting on passengers need to know if a flight is going to be late so they can plan accordingly
        -The sooner they know the better
-Why is it challenging/difficult
    -Determining how late a flight is going to be can depend on a lot of things
        -Which airline, did it takeoff late, where are they traveling to/from, WEATHER

Existing Techniques
-I am not sure about existing techniques for this Problem
    -It is possible that they just use the departure time offset as the arrival time offset, ignoring other factors

My Approach
-My approach will be to employ several different algorithms and compare their results
    -Decision trees, SVMs, regression
-Initially I will not factor in weather data, but I will bring it into the dataset and run the algorithms again
-I will build several graphs in order to look at the data and try to identify features that may be useful to include
-I will use several python libraries for my implementation
    -matplotlib for charts/graphs
    -scikitlearn for ML algorithms
    -Jupyter notebooks for sharing
-I will evaluate the algorithms based on their accuracy, recall and precision
